Jarett Maycott graduated from UC Berkeley in 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts 
in Political Science and minors in global public health, philosophy, and 
journalism. He began working as a health worker in the fall of 2020 where 
he coordinated with San Franciscoâ€™s COVID Command Center to advocate for 
and provide community-based resources to vulnerable populations satying 
at isolation and quarantine facilities. He worked with a large team of 
nurses to provide trauma-informed care to clients who struggle with 
substance use disorder and other mental and physical health conditions. The following summer 
he began working for the San Francisco Department of Public Health at the 
Center for Public Health Research. Here he contributed to work on mobile 
health interventions to prevent HIV infection and improve access to care 
for HIV, substance use, and mental health. Additionally, he has worked with the California 
Department of Public Health during the MPOX outbreak. His research interests are in 
social and spatial epidemiology, geosocial networking, and the health 
outcomes of perceived stigma among LGBTQ populations and people who use 
substances. In his free time, he loves to swim, find new restaurants, and 
explore the bay area with his camera.
